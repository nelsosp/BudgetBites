# Applied Computer Science Course Knowledge
This document serves to showcase the acquired learnings from past Applied Computer Science courses and applying them towards this Masters Project's direction and completion.

## Secure Software Engineering
- Primarily used for Login/Sign Up credentials to ensure proper parameters are in place to prevent any sort of attack to the database.
- Additionally, this course taught basics of understanding webapp Get/Post methods for possible webscraping.

## System Analysis and Design
- Possible use of different diagrams as related to Use Cases, Classes, Object, Flow, etc Diagrams.

## Requirements Specification
- Functional/Nonfuncitonal requirements gathering

## Software Testing
- Possible Unit, Ad-Hoc, etc testing to ensure proper system functionality without downtime

## Graphical User Interface Design
- To accommodate the UI of the system is easy to understand and navigate. As proposed, it should be straight to the point rather than complex and confusing along with finding things within 3 clicks away.

## Information Management and Science
- Applied learning from database architectures and proper design.
